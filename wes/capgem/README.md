### This is a revision to Japsa.

### Original Japsa
Japsa is a Java Package for Sequence Analysis. As the name implies, Japsa was
written primarily in Java. It contains a large number of ready to run programs
as well as a Java API. Please note that from our newest versions, it is required
Java 8 to compile and run from the source code. Prebuilt releases would need
JVM 1.8.0_144 or newer to run properly.

Details of Japsa can be found
in its documentation hosted on [ReadTheDocs](http://japsa.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)

Japsa is released under the accompanying BSD-like license.


### Revisions:
Only code related to CapSim are extracted to obtain fragments rather than short reads.
Script "frag2read.py" can then be used to simulate short reads from fragments generated by CapSim.

This model is called CapGem, because it combines the function of both CapSim and GemSim.


### Install:
To install CapSim, one can go to the folder containing the source code (CSiTE/wes/capgem) and then run make.
A sample command:
make install INSTALL_DIR=./ MXMEM=8000m SERVER=true
If INSTALL_DIR is specified to be a directory other than ‘./’, this directory should be added to environment variable PATH .
