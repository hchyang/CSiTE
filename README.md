# Coalescent Simulator for Tumor Evolution (CSiTE)

CSiTE is a Python program for jointly simulating Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and Copy Number Variants (CNVs) for a sample of tumor cells. It takes a coalescent tree (in the newick format) and simulates both types of somatic mutations along the history of the genealogy. At the end of the simulation, the program can output simulated variants (in the setting of a bulk tumor). The program also allows for simulating genotypes of individual tumor cells (i.e. single cell data). 

## Installing

CSiTE is written in Python3 and requires numpy.

CSiTE can be downloaded from github:

    git clone https://github.com/hchyang/CSiTE.git

## Running CSiTE

To run the program, a coalescent tree which captures the ancestral relationships of the tumor cells in a sample is required. The input tree file should be in the newick format, which can be generated by the [ms program](http://home.uchicago.edu/rhudson1/source/mksamples.html) with the `-T` option. ms program has the full-assemblage of the options needed to generate complex demographic histories of the sample. 

The two most important parameters in the simulation is the mutation rate of SNVs and CNVs (`--snv_rate`)/ (`--cnv_rate`). The mutational events in CSiTE are simulated according to the Poisson process with user specified parameters [see notes for extra discussions].  

Other than the rate of CNVs, there are six other parameters guiding CNVs simulation. 

`--cnv_length_beta` can be used to specify the beta/mean parameter of the exponential distribution (We assume the length of CNVs follows an exponential distribution. This parameter specifies the mean length of the CNV events).

`--cnv_length_max` can be used to set the upper limit of CNVs' length (This will effectively truncate the exponential distribution at this limit). 

`--del_prob`: A CNV event can be a deletion or an amplification. Using this parameter, we can specify the probability that a CNV event is a deletion.

`--copy_max` can be used to set the upper bound of an amplification event. When an amplification event happens, it will randomly pick a copy number according to a geometric like distribution with p(n+1)=w\*p(n). The w parameter can be specified by `-C/--copy_parameter`. The overall distribution will be normalized s.t. the total probability is 1. 

The coalescent tree only describes the polymorphic part of the sample. You can also simulate the truncal part of the tumor evolution (tumorigenesis) through two different approaches: 
a) specify the trunk length e.g. using `--trunk_length`. `--trunk_length` accepts a single float number that can be used as the branch length leading to the root of the coalescent tree.
b) specify the events on the trunk explicitly in a file through `--trunk_vars filename`. The format of the trunk variants file is described in the later section.
When the number of simulated cells is very large, the computational load can become very heavy. Given the fact that most of the mutational events are extremely rare, we implemented a pruning algorithm to trim the tree using `--prune` and `--prune_proportion` option to prune the larger phylogeny.

Other convenient options including:
- -D/--depth to simulate the variants under different sequencing coverage (i.e. given the specified coverage d, we will simulate a sequence coverage of x, where x is sampled from Poission(d)). 
- -p/--purity to set the purity of tumor sample
- -P/--ploidy to set the ploidy of tumor cells to simulate
- --length to set the length of sequence to simulate

### Input files

#### Tree file (-t/--tree)

Tree file should be in newick format, for example:

    ((2:0.083,4:0.083):0.345,(5:0.322,(1:0.030,3:0.030):0.292):0.105);

#### Trunk variants file (--trunk_vars)

You can simulate truncal variants by specify `--trunk_length`, or import trunk variants directly using `--trunk_vars` option.
The file format of truncal variants is like:
    
    #chr start end copy
    0 1 1 0
    1 12 123 +3
    0 12 123 -1

- **chr**:    which parental copy the variant locates in (0 means one parental copy, 1 means the other copy)
- **start**:  the start position of the variant
- **end**:    the end position of the variant
- **copy**:   an integer. 0: SNV, -1: deletion, +int: amplification

P.S. start and end are 0 based. And the region of each variant is similar to the bed file (inclusive on the left, but exclusive on the right end, i.e.[start,end)).

### Output files

#### SNVs file (-S/--snv)

This file contains the frequency information of simulated SNVs. It contains two columns. The first column is the SNV position (0-based), and the second column is the observed frequency across tumor cell population.

#### Genotype file (--genotype)

This file contains the genotype of each tumor cell on each SNV locus. Each SNV has one record. The first column is the coordinate of the SNV. Subsequently, there is one column for each tumor cell. The genotype is in the form of ‘M:N’. M denotes the number of alternative allele and N denotes the number of reference allele.

#### Individual CNV file (--ind_cnvs)

This file contains the CNVs on each parental copy of each sample individual. There are five clomns in this file:
    
    #Sample Parental        Start   End     Copy
    1       0       7912422 7930111 2
    1       1       43110140        43341629        1
    2       0       2255734 2299608 -1
    2       0       22660687        22788472        -1
    2       1       59756841        61142076        3

- **Sample**:  the start position of the variant
- **Parental**:    which parental copy the variant locates in (0 means one parental copy, 1 means another copy, 2 means another copy if your sample is triploid...)
- **Start**:    the start position of the CNV
- **End**:   the end position of the CNV
- **Copy**:   an integer. -1: deletion, +int: amplification

P.S. start and end are 0 based. And the region of each variant is similar to the bed file (inclusive on the left, but exclusive on the right end, i.e.[start,end)).

#### CNV profile file (--cnv_profile)

This file contains the CNV profile across the whole segment. There are 3 columns in this file. The first column is the start of the CNV region, and the second is the end of the CNV region. Both breakpoints are 0-based, defined CNVs covered on [start, end). The last column is the total copies of each region.

#### Log file (-g/--log)

This file contains logging information, e.g. the command line parameters and the random seed used. You can use these information to replicate the simulation. After setting the `--loglevel` as DEBUG, CSiTE will output detailed information about the simulation process.
