# Description: This script is used towrite an affiliation file which records the relationship between cells and samples, based on the output file of tumopp (sampled_ids.txt).
# Input:
#   input/sampled_ids.txt -- The file generated by tumopp2ms.py which records the nodes assigned to each sector
# Output:
#   input/affiliation_tumopp_random.txt, which serves as the affiliation file required by phylovar
# Command:  Rscript write_affiliation.R
